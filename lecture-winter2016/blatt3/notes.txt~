diagonal covariance: independence

gaussian formula for P(x1, x2) with diagonal Sigma: develop and we get P(x1)P(x2)



Decomposition of covariance:

assuma that there is a rotation of an isometric multivariate gaussian:
then x' = Rx

substituting in Pr(x)  = ..sigmadiag... ( -0.5 (Rx)T sigma(diag)^(-1) Rx =  ...
conclusion: sigma_full = R^T * Sigma_diag * R  "full covariance can be descomposed into rotation matrix and diagonal"
